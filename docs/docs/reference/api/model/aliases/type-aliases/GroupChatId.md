# Type Alias: GroupChatId

> **GroupChatId**: \`$\{AccountNumber\}-$\{number\}@$\{GroupChatServer\}\` \| [`GroupId`](/reference/api/model/aliases/type-aliases/GroupId.md)

A group chat ends with `@g.us` and usually has two parts, the timestamp of when it was created, and the user id of the number that created the group. For example `[creator number]-[timestamp]@g.us`

Example:

`"447123456789-1445627445@g.us"`
